Next Js is open-source React framework.

It is used for server-side rendering(SSR) and static-site genration(SSG).

*Server-Side Rendering (SSR) :

It involves rendering React components on the server before sending the HTML to the client's browser.

-->Rendering on the server-when a user requests a page from a next.js application, the server runs the REACT CODE for that particular page and generates the HTML content. 

what it runs ? -includes executing any  asynchronous operations required to render the page or data-fetch for that particular page.

-->Sending Pre-Rendered HTML- Once the server has generated the HTML content for the requested page, it sends this PRE-RENDERED HTML to the client's browser as the initial response. 

This allows the user to see the content of the page more quickly , since they DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR JAVASCRIPT to download and execute before rendering.

This leads to fast page loads and improves Search-engine optimization(SEO).

how it improves SEO ? --> because search engines can easily index static HTML files.

 *Static-site generation(SSG):
 
Enables you to PRE-RENDER ALL PAGES OF YOUR SITE, ensuring that they are available to search engine crawlers(index) even if they don't support JavaScript.
 
 Other functionalities are also implemented in next:
 
 *Automatic code splitting:
 
Automatically splits the code into smaller bundles, so the code for the required page only gets loaded which improves performance.
 
 *Client-side routing:
 
While creating routes for next applicaion this functionality includes a "file based-system" such as each page is associated with a specific file in the "pages" directory.

-->Though it is a Frontend-framework, the cause for using next.js as Full-stack is it handles backend functionality without depending on another language.

*API Routes: 

Next.js allows you to create API routes by simply creating files inside the "pages/api" directory, making it easy to build backend functionality.

Css support,typescript support and it provides automatic image optimization.

Therfore next.js is fast and has powerful features which allows us to mainly focus on programming/web logic rather than setup and configuration.
