Here is a story for developers:

Once upon a time, there was a developer named Alice. She was a brilliant programmer, but she had one problem: she was always getting stuck on the same bugs. She would spend hours trying to figure out what was wrong with her code, but she could never seem to find the solution.
One day, Alice was working on a particularly difficult bug. She had been working on it for days, and she was starting to get frustrated. She was about to give up when she heard a voice.
"Don't give up," the voice said. "You can do this."
Alice looked around, but she didn't see anyone.
"Who's there?" she asked.
"I'm the spirit of the code," the voice said. "I'm here to help you."
The spirit of the code told Alice that she needed to change her perspective. She needed to stop thinking about the bug as a problem, and start thinking about it as a challenge.
"Once you change your perspective," the spirit of the code said, "you'll be able to find the solution."
Alice took the spirit of the code's advice, and she started to think about the bug in a new way. She realized that the bug was actually a puzzle, and she just needed to find the right pieces to solve it.
Alice worked on the bug for a few more hours, and finally, she found the solution. She was so happy that she could have cried.
"Thank you," she said to the spirit of the code. "I couldn't have done it without you."
"You're welcome," the spirit of the code said. "Now go and write some great code."
Alice smiled and went back to work. She was a better developer because of the spirit of the code's help.

The end.
